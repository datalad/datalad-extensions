# List of extensions.
# Every extension could have a dict to customize in case of necessary
# additional dependencies, or "non-standard" naming on PyPI or github
#
# name:
#  pypi: <name on pypi, by default the same as the "name"
#  package: <package name to be tested, by default the same as the "name"
#  apt_depends:  # dependencies to install via APT necessary for testing
#  - package1
#  - ...
#
# If no customizations necessary, just place "None" as the value
#
# TODOs:
# - Extensions ATM expected to provide [devel] extras_require. TODO: add
#   option to avoid
# - Add matrix run for "master" of the extension, not just released
#   version.  For that would need github field with org/name unless
#   it is "datalad/name"
#

extensions:
 datalad_neuroimaging:
  apt_depends: [dcm2niix]
 datalad_container:
  apt_depends: [singularity-container]
 # mih is not interested, yoh has no authority to cook up a release
 #datalad_metalad:
 # pypi: datalad-metalad
 datalad_crawler:
 # datalad_webapp,     # not developed ATM, not sure if of interest to keep track
 # datalad_ukbiobank,  # yet to be renamed (issue filed), has no tests, so would fail
